This file is layout and plan for the minimum viable program to experiment with evolution in artificial creatures.

# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements and Specifications

### Summary:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program will simulate organisms with their own unique neural networks, based on genomes,
in order to explore how mutation and reproductive means affect evolution.

### Requirements:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Anticipated Challenges:

#### Effective Organization:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many moving parts, this project will require careful organization and planning, so it can
run as efficiently as possible.

#### Genomes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring that genomes are spliced together correctly when two or more organisms breed is a
complicated process that is key to this experiment working.

#### Visuals and Stats:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that creating a system that shows what is happening during the simulation will be
challenging. I will have to research libraries that allow me to create graphs, charts, and more.
